### Definition of Terms

##### Demand
Demand represents the quantity of an item required by a specific date or time. It is categorized by types such as purchase, build, or pick, which dictate how the demand should be fulfilled. Sales orders are a primary source of generating demand in this context.

###### **Build Demand**  
A quantity needs to be manufactured, assembled, or prepared.
###### **Demand Demand**  
A quantity is needed because it is required for use or consumption, indicating that it fulfills an existing demand.
###### **Pick Demand**  
A quantity needs to be transferred from one location to another within the organization.
###### **Purchase Demand**  
A quantity needs to be procured or bought. The purchase order should be placed 10 days (or 240 hours) before the item is required, accounting for the purchase lead time.
