# Pick Order

A pick order is an instruction to retrieve specific items from inventory and transport them to a designated location for processing or assembly. It ensures that all necessary components are collected and prepared for the next stage of production or fulfillment.

### Create a Pick Order:

1. To address a specific pick demand item, click **pick (item x)** (e.g., Lemon Meringue Tart). To address all pick demands at once, click **pick all.**  
   ⚠️ **Note:** Notification messages will appear at the beginning and end of batch demand generation. Click OK to continue.

2. To view the batch name, which is set to its initial value after generating demand, go to **Supply and Demand** and select **Demand Batch List** under your user account. The most recent item will be the batch you just generated.

3. Choose the demand you just generated, then click the expand button (>) next to it.  
   💡 **Tip:** The first item in the list under your account should be the demand you just generated.

4. In the Temporary Order Item list, pick orders are grouped by date and order number. Click **Create Order** next to the desired pick order.

5. Once created, the order will have:  
   5.1. A serial number and  

   5.2. Its status will change to **View Order**.
