# Pick Order

A pick order is an instruction to retrieve specific items from inventory and transport them to a designated location for processing or assembly. It ensures that all necessary components are collected and prepared for the next stage of production or fulfillment.

### Create a Pick Order:

1. **Navigate to Supply and Demand**

- Open the main menu and select **Supply and Demand**.

2. **Filter Demand Types**

- In the demand list, uncheck any irrelevant demand types (e.g., build demand, purchase demand) until only **pick demand** remains checked. Click **Search**.

	💡 **Tip:** To find demand from a specific customer, enter the customer’s name or **order number** in the search box.

- To address a specific pick demand item, click **Pick** next to the item (e.g., Lemon Meringue Tart). To address all pick demands at once, click **Pick All**.  
    ⚠️ **Note:** Notification messages will appear at the beginning and end of batch demand generation. Click **OK** to continue.
