# Pick Order

A pick order is an instruction to retrieve specific items from inventory and transport them to a designated location for processing or assembly. It ensures that all necessary components are collected and prepared for the next stage of production or fulfillment.

### Create a Pick Order:

1. **Navigate to Supply and Demand**

- Open the main menu and select **Supply and Demand**.

2. **Filter Demand Types**

- In the demand list, uncheck any irrelevant demand types (e.g., build demand, purchase demand) until only **pick demand** remains checked. Click **Search**.

	💡 **Tip:** 
1. **Select Pick Demand**

- To address a specific pick demand item, click **Pick** next to the item (e.g., Lemon Meringue Tart). To address all pick demands at once, click **Pick All**.  
    ⚠️ **Note:** Notification messages will appear at the beginning and end of batch demand generation. Click **OK** to continue.
    
4. **View Batch Name**

- To view the batch name (initially set after generating demand), go to **Supply and Demand** and select **Demand Batch List** under your user account.

5. **Choose Demand**

- Select the demand you just generated, then click the expand button (>) next to it.  
    💡 **Tip:** The first item in the list should be the demand you just generated.

6. **Create Pick Order**

- In the Temporary Order Item list, find pick orders grouped by date and order number. Click **Create Order** next to the desired pick order.

7. **Order Status**

- Once created, the order will have a serial number and its status will change to **View Order**.
