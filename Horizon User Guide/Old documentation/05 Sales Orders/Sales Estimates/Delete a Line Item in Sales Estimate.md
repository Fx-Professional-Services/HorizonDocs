### Delete a Sales Estimate Order Item
_________________________________

1. Navigate to the main menu and select **Sales Orders**.

2. Click on **Order Management**, then **Estimates**.

3. Look for the customer's name on the left side. You can search using either the [Find Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/VIII.%20Searching%20on%20Horizon/Browse%20Mode.md) or [Browse Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/Searching%20on%20Horizon/Browse%20Mode.md).

4. Find the sales estimate item you want to remove and click the delete button (✖︎).

⚠️ Note: You can only delete line items if the sales estimate hasn't been confirmed yet. If you need to make changes, click on **delete all** and [create new sales estimate order item](Create%20a%20Sales%20Estimate.md).

5. Confirm the deletion by clicking **YES** in the dialogue box. The total cost will automatically adjust.

6. Finally, click on **Save Changes** to save your edits. If you change your mind, you can click **Undo Changes** to discard them.
