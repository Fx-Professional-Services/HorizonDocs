### Flag an Existing Product as a Service
____
Here's a simple guide to turn an existing product into a service:
 
1. Go to **Item Management** and select **Services**.
2. Click on **Select Existing**. In the window that appears, search for the item you want to select, then click the add button (âœš) next to it. This will automatically select the item and close the window.
3. Once you're on the **Services** file, fill in any other necessary information like **Replenishment Method**, **Unit of Measure**, and **Minimum Quantity**.
4. Enter your **Role Name** and choose your **Job Title** by clicking on the job title picker icon. Then, select your job title from the list and click **Done**.
5. Check the fields adjacent to **Consumable**, **Sale Item**, and/or **Scale Quantity** to adjust the service settings.
6. To review your changes, go back to **Item Management** and select **All Items**.
7. Enter **Find Mode** again and type in the name of your newly added service.
8. Confirm that the **Service** box is checked and that the settings for **consumable**, **sale item**, and/or **need pick** match what you selected earlier.
