# SALES ORDERS

A sales order initiates the process of fulfilling a customer's request for products or services. Follow these streamlined steps for efficient sales order management:
##### 1. **Create a Sales Order

* Ensure the customer's record exists. If not, [create a new customer record](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/sales_order/Horizon%20User%20Guide/03%20Customers/Create%20a%20New%20Customer%20Record.md).
* Navigate to **Sales Orders** in the main menu. 
* Click **New Record**. Then click the¬†**Customer** box to select party. In the pop-up web picker, type the party's name in the search bar and press **Enter**, or scroll down, then click **Add**.
 * Set **Receive** **Date** and **Start At**; **End At** date is auto-scheduled.
 * **Click to select item** to choose a **Sale Order Item**. In the pop-up picker, type the product name in the **search nam**e bar or type a category as shown in the category column in **search category** bar. Click **Select** after choosing the product, adjust **Quantity**, and click **Done**. 
##### 2. **Manage Line Items**

* Adjust the price and quantity of the sale order line item by typing the new price and/or quantity. The subtotal and total costs will update automatically.
* Delete items by clicking the "x" icon or all items using **delete all**.

##### 3. **Apply Discounts and Taxes**

* In the **Discounts** section, click **Select Discount.** In the pop-up, choose a percentage (e.g., 10% off) or a fixed amount (e.g., $20 off) by clicking the add button (‚úö) and/or Done. The discount adjusts the subtotal and total costs automatically.

	üí° **Tips**
	* You can add more sales order items after applying discounts, and the discount values will update accordingly. 
	* To remove a discount, click on the "x" icon next to the discount. This action will adjust the total cost automatically.

* To make your sales order line item taxable, click the **tax** box until a checkmark (‚úîÔ∏è) appears. Taxes will be calculated in real-time, and the additional tax value will automatically reflect in the **total cost** calculation. 
##### 4. **Customize Item Details**

* To add or edit the customer-facing name and description for an item, click the hamburger menu button (‚ò∞).  A picker will appear, displaying the line item alongside its customer-facing name. Click the add button (‚úö) to select the line item from the picker and load its customer-facing name and description (based on the defaults set at the item level). Adjust the customer-facing name as needed.
##### 5. **Generate Demand and Invoice**

* Go to **Demand > Generate Demand** and wait for completion, then click OK.
* Return to the **Order** tab, and click **Confirm** to generate a sales invoice. 
* Click **generate invoice** and wait until the **Invoiced** status posts **Yes**. Then, click **Save Changes** at the bottom. Return to the **Main Menu** and select **Invoices.** Find the customer's name on the left side, using **Find Mode** or **Browse Mode**. The generated sales invoices for the selected customer should be there. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**:  Once confirmed, your sales order cannot be deleted or modified for Sales Channel, Customer Tier, or Payment Terms. To undo, click **unconfirm**.

##### 6. **Finalize and Print**
- Click **Save Changes** to apply updates.
