A sales order initiates the process of fulfilling a customer's request for products or services. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to streamline sales order creation.
### Create a Sales Order
______________________
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: To create a sales order, you need the customer's record. If not, you must first [create a new customer record](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/sales_order/Horizon%20User%20Guide/03%20Customers/Create%20a%20New%20Customer%20Record.md).

1. Select **Sales Orders** from the main menu. 

2. Click **New Record**. Then click the¬†**Customer** box to select party. In the pop-up web picker, type the party's name in the search bar and press **Enter**, or scroll down, then click **Add**.

3. Set **Receive** **Date** and **Start At**; **End At** date is auto-scheduled.

4. **Click to select item** to choose a **Sale Order Item**. Type the product name in the **search name** bar or scroll through the list. Alternatively, **search by category** using keywords in the category column to filter results. Then, click **Select** for your chosen product, adjust **Quantity** as needed, and click **Done** after making your selections. 

	 üí° **Tip**: To delete a line item in the **Order** tab,  click the nearby "x" icon. To delete all items, click **delete all** button.

5. To adjust the price and quantity of the sale order line item, simply type in the new price and/or quantity you want. The subtotal and total costs will update automatically.

6. To make your sales order line item taxable, click the **tax** box until a checkmark (‚úîÔ∏è) appears. Taxes will be calculated in real-time, and the additional tax value will automatically reflect in the **total cost** calculation. Click **Save Changes** to apply your updates. 

7. To add or edit the customer-facing name and description for an item, click the hamburger menu button (‚ò∞) on the right side of the sales order item list. A picker will appear, displaying the line item alongside its customer-facing name. Click the add button (‚úö) to select the line item from the picker and load its customer-facing name and description (based on the defaults set at the item level). Adjust the customer-facing name as needed.

8. Generate demand by clicking **Demand**> **generate demand**, and wait for completion, then click OK. 

9. To generate a sales invoice, go back to **Order** tab and click **confirm**. 

	‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Once confirmed, your sales order cannot be deleted or modified for Sales Channel, Customer Tier, or Payment Terms. To undo, click **unconfirm**.

10. Click **generate invoice** and wait until the **Invoiced** status posts **Yes**. Then, click **Save Changes** at the bottom. Return to the **Main Menu** and select **Invoices.** Find the customer's name on the left side, using **Find Mode** or **Browse Mode**. The generated sales invoices for the selected customer should be there. 

11. To print your **Sales Order**, click on **Print** (üñ®Ô∏è) at the upper right side of the screen. This will prepare the sales order document for printing.
