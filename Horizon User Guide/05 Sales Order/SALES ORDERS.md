### Create a Sales Order
______________________
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: To create a sales order, you need the customer's record. If not, you must first [create a new customer record](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/sales_order/Horizon%20User%20Guide/03%20Customers/Create%20a%20New%20Customer%20Record.md).

1. Select **Sales Orders** from the main menu. 

2. Click **New Record**.

3. Click the¬†**Customer** box to select party. In the pop-up web picker, type the party's name in the search bar and press **Enter**, or scroll down, then click **Add**.

4. Set **Receive** **Date** and **Start At**; **End At** date is auto-scheduled.

5. **Click to select item** to choose a **Sale Order Item**. Type the product name in the search bar or scroll through the list. Alternatively, search by category using keywords in the category column to filter results.

6. Click **Select** for your chosen product, adjust **Quantity** as needed, and click **Done** after making your selections. 

	 üí° **Tip**: To delete your selection, click on the item and then click the nearby "x" icon. To delete all items, look for a button labeled **Delete All**.

7. Click the hamburger menu button (‚ò∞) located at the rightmost of the sales order item list. A picker will appear, displaying the line item along with its customer-facing name. Select the line item from the picker to load its customer-facing name and description (based on the defaults set at the item level). Adjust the customer-facing name as needed.

8. Generate demand by clicking **Demand**> **Generate Demand**, and wait for completion, then click OK. 

9. Go to **Order** tab and click **Confirm** to generate a sales invoice. 

	‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**:  Once confirmed, your sales order cannot be deleted or modified for customer tier, sales channel, or payment terms. To undo, click **Unconfirm**.

10. Click **generate invoice** and wait until the **Invoiced** status posts **Yes**. Then, click **Save Changes** at the bottom. 

11. Return to the **Main Menu** and select **Invoices.** Find the customer's name on the left side, using **Find Mode** or **Browse Mode**. The generated sales invoices for the selected customer should be there.
