# Address Demand

1. Go to **Supply and Demand** on the main menu.
2. In the demand list, uncheck the types of demand you don’t need (build, demand, pick, and purchase) until only the relevant type remains checked, then click **Search**. 
3. To set the date range for the demand, click **select date range** and choose from the pop-up menu: Today, Tomorrow, or Next Week. The calendar will automatically update to your selection and filter the results accordingly.
4. To find demand from a specific customer, enter the customer’s name or **order number** in the search box.
5. You can address either a specific demand item, a specific type of demand, or all demands:

- For a specific demand item, click **build (Item)**, **demand (Item)**, **pick (Item)**, or **purchase (Item)**.
- For a specific type of demand, click **build all**, **demand all**, **pick all**, or **purchase all**.
- To address all demands, click **address all x demands**.

7. Confirmation pop-ups will appear at the start and end of batch demand generation. Click OK to proceed.
