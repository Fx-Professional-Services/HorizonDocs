### Delete a Payment Record
__________________________

⚠️ Note:
You can only delete your payment record if it hasn't been confirmed yet. 

1. Go to **Customers** on the main menu. 
2. Click on the **Customer** tab.
3. Select the customer's name from the list on the left pane, using either the [Find Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/VIII.%20Searching%20on%20Horizon/Find%20Mode.md) or [Browse Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/VIII.%20Searching%20on%20Horizon/Browse%20Mode.md).
4. Go to the **Add Payment** tab, choose the payment record you want to remove and click on the icon  (✖︎) next to it. 
5. Confirm by clicking **Delete** in the dialogue box. 

Once you select **Delete**, your payment record will be immediately deleted. If you accidentally deleted your record, just [create another payment record](Create%20a%20Payment%20Record.md).

If you forgot your password and are not able to delete your payment, please try to [reset your password](V.%20Reset%20Your%20Password.md).
