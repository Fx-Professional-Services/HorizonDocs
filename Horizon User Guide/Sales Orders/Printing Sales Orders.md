### Print Sales Orders
____________________________

1. Start by opening the **Sales Orders** section from the main menu.
2. Next, go to **Order Management**, then select **Estimates**.
3. Find the specific order you want to print. You can do this by using either the [Browse Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/Searching%20on%20Horizon/Browse%20Mode.md) or [Find Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/Searching%20on%20Horizon/Find%20Mode.md) options on the left side of the screen.
4. Once you've located the order, click on the **Print** icon (it looks like a printer) on the right side of the screen. This will prepare the sales order document for printing.

That's it! Your sales order should now be ready to print.
