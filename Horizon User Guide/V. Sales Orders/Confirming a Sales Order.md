### Confirm a Sales Order
______________________

Confirming a sales order is a necessary step before generating a sales invoice or unconfirming a sales order. Follow these simple steps to confirm a sales order:

1. Navigate to the main menu and select **Sales Orders**.

2. Choose a party on the left pane using [Browse Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/VIII.%20Searching%20on%20Horizon/Browse%20Mode.md) or [Find Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/VIII.%20Searching%20on%20Horizon/Find%20Mode.md). 

3. Once you've chosen the party, click on the **confirm** button.

⚠️ Note: Once a sales order is confirmed, you won't be able to change the customer tier, sales channel, or payment terms.

4. Click on **Save Changes** at the bottom to keep your changes.
