### Print Sales Orders
____________________________
1. **Access Sales Orders:** Open the **Sales Orders** section from the main menu.

2. **Find Your Order:** Locate the specific sales order you wish to print. You can do this by using either the [Browse Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/Searching%20on%20Horizon/Browse%20Mode.md) or [Find Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/VIII.%20Searching%20on%20Horizon/Find%20Mode.md) options provided on the left side of the screen.
    
3. **Print the Order:** Once you've found the order, click on the **Print** icon (it resembles a printer) located on the right side of the screen. This will prepare the sales order document for printing.
    
That's it! Your sales order should now be ready to print.
