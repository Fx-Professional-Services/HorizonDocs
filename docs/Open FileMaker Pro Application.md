### Steps to Open FileMaker Pro

1. Launch FileMaker Pro application: This means opening the FileMaker Pro program on your computer. You might find it in your list of applications or on your desktop if you've created a shortcut there.
    
2. **On the menu bar (Mac), choose File > Hosts**: This step involves navigating through the menus at the top of your screen. On a Mac computer, the menu bar is typically located at the top of the screen. Click on "File" in the menu bar, then navigate to the "Hosts" option within the File menu.
    
3. **Choose your server**: After selecting "Hosts" from the File menu, you'll likely see a list of servers. These are computers or devices that are hosting FileMaker Pro databases. Select the server that you want to connect to by clicking on it.
    
4. **Click on Horizon file, then click OK**: Once you've selected your server, you'll see a list of files or databases that are available on that server. Look for the "Horizon" file in the list and click on it to select it. Then, typically, you'll find an "OK" button somewhere on the screenâ€”click that to confirm your selection and open the "Horizon" file in FileMaker Pro.
    

By following these steps, you should be able to launch the FileMaker Pro application, connect to a server, and open the "Horizon" file within the application.
